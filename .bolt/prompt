# Salvage Parts AI Tracker - Complete Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Project Mission

**Build your AI-powered garage buddy that turns salvage chaos into organized creativity.**

This isn't just another inventory app - it's an intelligent workshop companion that identifies mystery components, remembers every conversation, and generates creative project ideas from your salvage collection. Think of it as having an expert friend who never forgets anything and is always excited to help you build cool shit.

## 🚀 The Problem We're Solving

**"What the fuck is this component, and what can I build with the random shit in my parts bin?"**

Every maker faces this daily:
- Boxes of salvaged components with zero documentation
- Mystery parts from disassembled devices
- No idea what projects are possible with available parts
- Forgetting what you learned about components last month
- Spending hours researching the same parts repeatedly

Current solutions suck: enterprise inventory systems are overkill, spreadsheets don't help with identification, and nothing learns from your interactions.

## 🤖 The AI-Powered Solution

An intelligent desktop application that:

1. **Identifies mystery components** from photos using Claude Vision
2. **Remembers everything** through persistent AI memory (mem0)
3. **Generates project ideas** based on your actual parts inventory
4. **Provides conversational help** like having an expert in your workshop
5. **Tracks build sessions** with progress notes and photos
6. **Learns your preferences** and gets smarter over time

## 📋 Your Implementation Roadmap

### **CRITICAL: Follow task-master.md Step-by-Step**

**This project has a complete, tested implementation guide in `task-master.md`**

The task-master contains:
- ✅ **7 detailed phases** with exact time estimates (30-40 hours total)
- ✅ **Step-by-step checklists** with specific files to create
- ✅ **Code examples** and implementation patterns
- ✅ **Testing procedures** for every feature
- ✅ **Quality gates** to ensure each phase works before proceeding
- ✅ **Troubleshooting guides** for common issues
- ✅ **Success criteria** for each milestone

### **Phase Overview from task-master.md**

| Phase | Focus | Time | Key Deliverables |
|-------|-------|------|------------------|
| **1** | Environment Setup | 2-3h | Dev environment, dependencies, API keys |
| **2** | Database & Auth | 3-4h | Supabase schema, authentication, RLS |
| **3** | Frontend Foundation | 4-5h | Components, layout, routing, state |
| **4** | Core Features | 8-10h | Parts CRUD, projects, file uploads |
| **5** | AI Integration | 6-8h | Claude API, mem0, chat interface |
| **6** | Polish & Deploy | 4-5h | UI polish, optimization, production |

### **Implementation Strategy**

**DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THIS APPROACH:**

1. **Start with task-master.md Phase 1** - Don't skip environment setup
2. **Complete every checkbox** before moving to next phase
3. **Test at each checkpoint** - Broken foundations = broken app
4. **Follow the file structure** exactly as specified
5. **Use the provided code examples** - they're tested and work
6. **Validate success criteria** before proceeding to next phase

### **Critical Dependencies**
